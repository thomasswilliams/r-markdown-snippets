For this R Markdown file to run correctly, create a file called `.env` in the same directory, with contents:

```
DATABASE_USER=test_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD="correct horse battery staple"

```

See the blog post at <https://thomasswilliams.github.io/development/r/2022/10/20/r-markdown-env-file.html> for background.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
# dotenv for loading a .env file as environment variables
# https://github.com/gaborcsardi/dotenv
library(dotenv)

# load the file (defaults to “.env” file)
# will throw error if file is not found, or file is not valid
dotenv::load_dot_env()

# get values from environment variables
# will be returned as character vectors (see docs at https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.6.2/topics/Sys.getenv)
# will be NULL if the passed name does not exist
# also used to get other system environment variables like “TEMP”, “PATH”, "SHELL" etc.
user <- Sys.getenv("DATABASE_USER")
password <- Sys.getenv("DATABASE_PASSWORD")

# do something with values
paste0("User: ", user)
paste0("Password: ", password)
```
